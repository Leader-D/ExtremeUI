## What is ExtremeUI?

ExtremeUI is a low-level, high-performance GUI framework written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org), built around **Signed Distance Fields (SDF)** for shape rendering and **SPIR-V** as its core shader target.

Instead of relying on traditional image-based UI or heavyweight widget toolkits, ExtremeUI renders every element using pure SDF math — giving you resolution-independent, GPU-accelerated UI that works across any screen size or pixel density, with no bitmaps and no image assets.

The coordinate system is unified: every screen is treated as a 100x100 unit grid, where `(0,0)` is the bottom-left and `(100,100)` is the top-right. One unit expands or contracts automatically based on the actual screen resolution.

---

## Usage

The user defines window settings once:

```zig
const xui = @import("ExtremeUI");

pub fn main() !void {
    xui.window(.{
        .width  = 1280,
        .height = 720,
        .title  = "My App",
    });
}
```

Then defines UI elements as constants using XUI shapes:

```zig
const my_button = Circle{
    .position = Vec2{ .x = 50, .y = 50 },
    .size     = Size.from(1.0, 1.0),
    .rotation = Rotation.from(0),
    .radius   = 10,
    .color    = Colors.red,
};
```

ExtremeUI handles everything else: coordinate conversion, SDF evaluation per pixel, SPIR-V compilation, and GPU submission.

## How It Works

```
xui.window()
    └── Core/Window.zig
            └── Core/Config.zig        # screen_width, screen_height, unit_x, unit_y

Circle.sdf(pixel_x, pixel_y)
    └── Transform/Position.apply()     # pixel -> local space
    └── Transform/Rotation.apply()     # rotate around center
    └── Transform/Size.apply()         # scale radius
    └── sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - radius      # signed distance

Core/Platform/Linux_win.zig            # opens X11 or Wayland window
    └── Core/Platform/Vulkan_pip.zig   # Vulkan pipeline
            └── Runtime/Engine.zig     # SPIR-V bytecode -> GPU
```
